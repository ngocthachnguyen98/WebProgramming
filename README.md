# Web Programming - semester 2 2018 at RMIT (HD)

This is a project that I was asked to develop a website for a shop or business. I chose to develop for a takeaway shop that I used to work at.

They have few items with different selections for each in terms of flavors and fillings. 

The website helps the users know more about the shop, make orders, check out and obtain a receipt for their order.

For this assignment, I was required to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Bootstrap. It was a nice introduction to web programming.
