<summary><b>About Banh Mi</b></summary>
Bánh mì or banh mi refers to a kind of sandwich that consists of a Vietnamese single-serving baguette, also called bánh mì in Vietnamese, which is split lengthwise and filled with various savory ingredients. We have the right bread: pillowy soft on the inside, crusty AF on the outside (if it’s not covering your lap in crumbs and bread-shrapnel, it’s not a proper banh mi at all). The meat should be a little bit fatty and suspicious. The carrots crisp and crunchy. Always a ‘Yes’ to margarine, and go heavy on the cucumber and coriander (yep, we went there). Oh yeah, and it shouldn’t cost you more than a tenner under any circumstances.<br>

<summary><b>About Rice Paper Roll</b></summary>
Gỏi cuốn, Vietnamese spring roll or summer roll, is a Vietnamese dish traditionally consisting of pork, prawn, vegetables, bún (rice vermicelli), and other ingredients wrapped in Vietnamese bánh tráng (commonly known as rice paper). Contrary to popular belief that they are from China, the fresh spring roll's origins are in Vietnam since the ingredients are different, and they are served fresh while others are served fried, like the Vietnamese chả giò. They are served at room temperature (or cooled) and are not deep fried or cooked on the outside. These rolls are considered to be a very popular appetizer with customers in Vietnamese restaurants.<br>
